# TelegramPostScheduler
A simple GUI app for scheduling telegram posts and parsing post description based on common template.

## Purpose
This app is meant to be a really simple app that can do a one job - let the user send or schedule a telegram post to the specific channel containing an image and a description that can be parsed inside this app following a common template and using a few text fields. It should be also possible to use this app only to parse the description without sending the post for manual post creation inside the telegram (as telegram bots still don't support gallery posts).
